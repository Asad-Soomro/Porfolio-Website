          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
          I am a certified professional data scientist building Deep Learning applications or models. 
          Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. 
          I am proficient in building Deep Learning models using Pytorch, Tensor, and Keras. 
          Moreover, being a quick learner helps me to pick up new tech stacks as needed. 
          I believe that a great developer is not using one specific language but chooses the best tool for the job.
          Moreover, in my leasure time i love to make web/mobile app. Like this website i built my website!
